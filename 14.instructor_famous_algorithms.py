"""
For our practice today we are going to look at few solutions to common Python algorithms
that are frequently asked problems in coding interview rounds.

The exercises covered in this practice (together with their solutions) are adjusted interpretations of problems
available on some coding practice websites.

Solutions we present here are just indicative ones -- there might be other ways to solve tasks, but this is a god start!
